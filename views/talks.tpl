    <li class="python"><h3>Delta Debugging</h3><p>Beyond pdb</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This presentation helps you to debug Python code more systematically. I am going to present an example for <b>Delta Debugging</b>Â (sometimes dubbed automatic debugging), a scientific debugging approach pioneered by <b>Prof. Andreas Zeller</b>, author of the landmark book in this field: <a href="http://www.wyprogramsfail.com" target="_blank">Why Programs Fail</a>. The example will introduce Delta Debugging itself and highlight its strengths and weaknesses. If would like to know what other options for debugging you have apart from the Python debugger and the occasional <code>print</code> statement, this talk is for you.</p>

    <li class="teaching"><h3>The Mechanics of Learning</h3><p>What Confucius, Montessori and Coding Katas have in common</li>
</ul>

<p>In this talk, I will present ubiquitous patterns in successful learning that help you to improve your own abilities, mentor junior developers and build key skills in a team. We will examine what <em>Confucius, Montessori and Coding Katas</em> have in common. You will explore a process for creating interesting learning challenges and critically assess whether the mechanics of learning apply to programming only, or to topics like software architecture or Scrum as well.</p>

<ul class="list-spectre">  
    <li class="leadership"><h3>Sun Tzu</h3><p>What a peaceful leader can learn from ancient war strategy</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Knowing yourself and knowing your adversary, you will not be conquered in a thousand battles.</em></p>

<p>The Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote a book on military strategy 2500 years ago. Today, the book is part of standard literature for managers and leaders worldwide. What leadership techniques have made *"The Art of War"* timeless reading even for a pacifist? <em>"The Art of War"</em> teaches that leadership is a craft that requires considering forces invisible at first. The real adversary is often not an armed force, but plans, morale and deception. If <em>"the highest excellence is to conquer without battle"</em>, what can we do to conquer the immaterial?</p>

<p>In this workshop, you will apply three leadership tools based on Sun Tzus philosophy.</p>
