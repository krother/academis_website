<div><h1>Talks</h1>

I am prepared to talk on the following subjects off the cuff:

<h2>The Mechanics of Learning</h2>

<p>How does learning technology skills work?</p>

<p>I claim that the concept of <em>"Coding Katas"</em> is ubiquitous to learning.</p>

<p>In this talk, you will examine what Confucius, Montessori and DjangoGirls have in common. You will explore a lean process for creating interesting learning challenges. You will critically assess whether the mechanics of learning apply to programming only, or to 'soft' topics like architecture or Scrum as well.</p>

<p>As a result I hope to give you a tool that helps you to improve your own abilities, mentor junior developers and build key skills in a team.

<h2>How to write a Bytecode interpreter</h2>

<p>After watching a movie on Alan Turing, I designed a simple
assembler language on an interpreter written in the brainf*** language. Here is an excerpt of the source code:</p>
<code>->-->>>>>>,>,<[>>,>,<]<<[<<]>>[-<<+<<+>>>>]>[-<<+<<+>>>>]<<<<<[->>>>+<<<<]>[->>>>+<<<<]>[<<<[-]>[-]>[-]>-[-<+<<+>>>]<<+<[>[-]<-]>[<<<.>>>-]>[->+<]>[<<<[-]>[-]>[-]>-[-<+<<+>>>]<<+<[>[-]<-]>[<<.>>-]>[->+<]>[<<<[-]>[-]>[-]>-[-<+<<+>>>]<<+<[>[-]<-]>[>>>.<<<-]>[->+<]>[<<<[-]>[-]>[-]>-[-<+<<+>>>]<<
</code>

<p>The talk illustrates fundamental concepts of computation like instruction sets, processor registers and Turing completeness.</p>
