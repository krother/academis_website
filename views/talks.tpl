<h1>Talks</h1>

I am prepared to talk on the following subjects:

<h2>Delta Debugging: Beyond pdb</h2>

<p>The aim of this presentation is to improve our abilities to debug Python code more systematically. I am going to present an example for <b>Delta Debugging</b>Â (sometimes dubbed automatic debugging), a scientific debugging approach pioneered by <b>Prof. Andreas Zeller</b>, author of the landmark book in this field: <a href="http://www.wyprogramsfail.com" target="_blank">Why Programs Fail</a>. The example will introduce Delta Debugging itself and highlight its strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>A moderated discussion on debugging techniques will follow after the presentation. If you have ever considered anything apart from the Python debugger and the occasional <code>print</code> statement/function, this will be a good moment to share your experience.</p>

<h2>The Mechanics of Learning</h2>

<p>How does learning technology skills work?</p>

<p>I claim that the concept of <em>"Coding Katas"</em> is ubiquitous to learning.</p>

<p>In this talk, you will examine what Confucius, Montessori and DjangoGirls have in common. You will explore a lean process for creating interesting learning challenges. You will critically assess whether the mechanics of learning apply to programming only, or to 'soft' topics like architecture or Scrum as well.</p>

<p>As a result I hope to give you a tool that helps you to improve your own abilities, mentor junior developers and build key skills in a team.
